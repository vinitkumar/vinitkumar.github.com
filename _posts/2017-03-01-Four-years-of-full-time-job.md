I joined Socialschools(then Changer) at the same date in 2013. It's has been quite an honor working with many awesome people.
Then, I was only a fresh graduate dreaming of making a dent in the universe. Today, I am writing code for one of the fastest
growing Communication platform for Education in The Netherlands.

First I would like to thank Ruben, Jonathan, Jos for giving me the chance to work at Changer. Next, the four years at Socialschools would have never been possible if it was not for my colleagues.

I had worked with Robert for the most of the time during this journey. He has always been the most friendly person and shares the same passion and fire to do amazing work for Socialschools.

 Aashish has been a great mentor, friend, and guide and we have spent countless hours building new features, fixing nasty bugs and coffee.

Bert has been a great part of Socialschools and has been a driving force is growing us to the next level.

Marieke has been pretty amazing at implementation and putting users interest and perspective in the product. i

And of course, Jos has been an amazing mentor and technical guide in my growth as an Engineer. The newer team members like Edwin, Harry, Shanice & Trui have been great too and are doing a great job in their field.

I would also like to thanks to my Ma, Moma, Papa, Baba, Jhunu and especially my wife Rituparna who have supported me at each and every step and shared the joys and difficulties together. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them.

I would also like to summarize the core of what I have learned during this four years:

- Any work you do, You do it with pride. This is something I learn from Ruben early on in my career. We sometimes run after big achievements and stop enjoying small jobs that are always there. Never shy away from work, however small and do it with utmost pride. Even a small CSS change that brings joy to your customer is worth it and you should be happy to do it.
Thanks, Ruben :)

- Think of users perspective and build for your users and use what you build.

- Writing clean, maintainable, testable code requires thinking and it is a very good investment.

- You need to have passion and vision when building a product. It will have its lows too and you need someone to motivate, innovate and think out of the box for the product.

- You need to be pragmatic while writing code and it's not only the quantity of code that matters but what you deliver as a product is what really matters.

- Enjoy what you do and do what you enjoy!
