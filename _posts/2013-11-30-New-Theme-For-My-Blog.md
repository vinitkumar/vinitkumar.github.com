So this week, I wrote a new theme for my blog. One big reason was that
using theme created by others were not fitting my needs and I was not
inspired to write anymore. This was odd because in general I love
writing posts on my blog.

I felt the design was taking too much attention and the content has
taken a back seat. 

There are few good things about this new theme i created:

- More emphasis is given to the content.
- Good fonts has been applied and it looks pretty on all devices.
- The structure is pretty simple and there are mainly three tabs.


I like it the way it has come up, though some more improvements such as
better responsive navbar and more SEO fields would make it way soon.
