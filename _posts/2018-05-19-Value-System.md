As humans, I think it is pretty important that we sometimes look deep into the soul and see what defines us
and what is the value-system we believe in.

Here are values I believe in. Remember this is not an all exhaustive list and I might update it later.

- Spread love, not hate.

- Empathy is a very important quality.

- Do not engage in useless arguments, name calling, trolling.

- Life is too short to stay angry on anyone or anything for too long.

- Be punctual and respect other's time as well.

- Do not reply in haste, especially when you are angry.

- Be easy on yourself.

- Life is one of the greatest gifts, value it, cherish it.

- Smile often, care about those around you.

- Never leave an opportunity for a random act of kindness.

- Surround yourself with what you love and block all negativity that bothers you.
