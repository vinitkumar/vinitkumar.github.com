Last few months has been really exciting for me. Since, i joined [Changer](http://changer.nl)
on 1st February.
Here are some things i learnt in these 5 months:

- I should try to learn and own the stack i am  working on. Trying to do a lot of things at a time is not going to help much.
- Contributing a lot to open source is a good thing and i am lucky my company encourages me to do so.
- I should write a lot of code and read a lot more. i shoudl invest time in learning and understanding my product. 
- I should think about code quality and maintainability before i write a single line of code. It is tough things to get right at first, but with hard work i could achieve this.
- Having good understanding and relationship with the people you daily work with is important. It is must to have a smile my face.
- I must fun with what i do. Period!
