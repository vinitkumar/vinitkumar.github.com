Work has a really important role in anyone's life. I feel there are some things that really help us
do our work nicely.

- Arrive on time. Don't be late without giving a heads up to the other party.

- Think logically before making any decision.

- Keep the communication lines open.

- If you are facing a difficulty admit it, don't let your ego come in between.

- There are always things that could be difficult, persistent hard work is the only way to crack them.

- Don't fall victim of easy goals, work with full passion on whatever you have decided.

- Don't think much about other things, just concentrate on your work.


## Most important things:

- No work is too small, everything teaches you something new.

- Life is too small to waste on useless arguments.

- Keep your mouth shut when you don't have something useful to contribute.

- Read books, improve your skills.

- Challenge your limits.

- Read well, write well.
