Hello People!

It has indeed been very long since I last wrote a blog post. It sure feels good to start it again. Firstly, if you
enjoy my writing, I am sorry for this big gap. I was very busy in writing code at my work.

Here are some important updates about what happened:

- I got married! Yay :) I got married in December with my lovely girlfriend. It has been pretty amazing last three months
with her.

- I wrote various features for my product and there are more than 20k users using those features right now and the feedback
has been quite good actually.

- I write less code these days and spend more time thinking. I think it is better this way. I felt burnout with my previous lifestyle. Now,
I wait to write code every morning.

- I feel less annoyed with stupidity around me and have a better coping mechanism.

I have decided to be more consistent with my reading habits. I hope to be more sincere this time.
That's it for now. Will write another post soon.
